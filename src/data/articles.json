Within an hour: 20,000 views. 319 likes. And counting."

A permanent shift in what markets value. Community belief as an asset class. Memecoins as the vehicle. And SPX6900 as the flagship. Murad's pinned video laying out 150 reasons SPX hits $1 TRILLION has 3.2 million views. His community isn't just holding — they're DCAing $5 a day, every day, for 246 straight days. That's not trading. That's religion."

If you're Murad, that's a 3,000x discount to his $1T target. The last time SPX was this cheap relative to his thesis, it rallied 15% in a single move. It's back down now. The question isn't whether Murad is right or wrong — it's whether 735K followers act on this signal before you do."

When he tells his entire audience to \"read this in full to understand where the next multi-trillion dollar opportunity lies\" — that's not a casual retweet. That's a man with a $340M-market-cap thesis putting his reputation on the line. Again. The replies are already flooding in. The community is mobilizing. Whether SPX6900 is the future of finance or the most elaborate memecoin cope ever constructed, one thing is undeniable: the next 48 hours are going to be volatile. And the people who read this first will be positioned accordingly."

His incentive to pump aligns perfectly with his incentive to be right. That said: ignore a 735K-follower alpha call at your own risk. The last three times Murad went this hard on a conviction post, the token moved 40%+ within a week. Set your alerts. Do your own research. But don't say we didn't tell you."
