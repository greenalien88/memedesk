The ingredients are identical: cute animal goes viral on mainstream media, crypto traders weaponize the emotional narrative, token launches on Solana with 0% tax and renounced ownership, and momentum compounds as each new news cycle feeds the next. Nansen data shows public figure holdings surged 89.69% in seven days. The story has been picked up by Yahoo Finance, BeInCrypto, CoinGecko, and dozens of crypto outlets.

That's not organic distribution. That's a supply chain. Meanwhile, Nansen data tells a darker story beneath the surface: while public figures accumulated aggressively (+89.69%), smart money and whale holdings actually declined over the same period.

The token just got exchange listings, which historically provide both a liquidity boost and an exit window for insiders. The Washington Post video is still circulating. Punch the monkey is still trending. Every new mainstream article feeds the narrative. But the on-chain data is flashing warnings that the viral story might be covering for something else entirely.

The MOODENG comparison cuts both ways: MOODENG hit $600M, but dozens of MOODENG copycats hit zero. Smart money is exiting while public figures are entering. That's not a bullish signal — that's a distribution pattern with better marketing. If you're already in profit, consider taking some off the table.
