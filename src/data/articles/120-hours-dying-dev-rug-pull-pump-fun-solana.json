Pump.fun has enabled the creation of millions of tokens on Solana, and by some estimates, 90-95% of tokens launched on the platform either rug pull or die within 48 hours. The platform's bonding curve mechanism offers some baseline protection — it's harder to pull a traditional liquidity rug compared to a raw contract deploy — but creator fees and bundled trading strategies give bad actors plenty of extraction vectors."

A wheelchair, a sad story, and a camera were all it took to bypass every rational filter that crypto traders supposedly have. The platform has since seen increased scrutiny, but the fundamental problem remains: zero-barrier token creation means zero-barrier scams."

If the primary reason to buy a token is a feeling — sympathy, outrage, FOMO, patriotism — that feeling is being manufactured to extract your money. Every single time. Second: livestream presence means nothing. A face on camera is not KYC. A sad story is not due diligence. Third: when someone explicitly says 'I will never rug pull,' run. That sentence has preceded more rugs than any other in crypto history. Fourth: Pump.fun tokens are high-risk by default. The barrier to create one is effectively zero. Treat every new launch as guilty until proven innocent."

This isn't a cautionary tale about meme coins — it's a cautionary tale about trusting strangers on the internet with your money, no matter how convincing the story. The token is at zero. It will stay at zero. If you lost money on this, the only recovery is the lesson."

The developer claimed to be terminally ill with 120 hours to live and promised to direct token creator fees to his family.

After the rug pull, all social media accounts were scrubbed and the identity remains unknown. The scam was linked to an entity called 'Creator Capital Markets.'"

          "answer": "Pump.fun's bonding curve offers some basic protections compared to raw contract deploys, but the platform has extremely low barriers to token creation. By some estimates, 90-95% of tokens launched on Pump.fun either rug pull or die within 48 hours. Always verify liquidity locks, check dev wallet holdings, and never invest based on emotional narratives alone."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can the 120 Hours developer be identified or prosecuted?",
          "answer": "As of now, the developer remains anonymous. All social accounts were scrubbed post-rug. While on-chain data preserves the wallet addresses and transaction history, connecting these to a real identity requires law enforcement cooperation with exchanges where funds may have been off-ramped. In practice, most Pump.fun rug pulls go unpunished."
