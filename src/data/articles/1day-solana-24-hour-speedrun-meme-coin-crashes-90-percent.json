The tokenomics screamed exit liquidity from the jump: a Pump.fun launch with no locked liquidity, no renounced contract, and a 'speedrun' framing that gave early wallets permission to dump guilt-free."

The creator weaponized transparency: by announcing the token would die in 24 hours, they created a PvP arena where everyone thinks they'll be the one to time the exit. It's musical chairs with a timer, and the music stopped in 80 minutes instead of 24 hours."

Early buyers who got in and out during the first 15 minutes likely made money. The other 1,400+ wallets? They're splitting $4,700 in market cap. That's $3.35 per wallet if everyone got equal shares — which they obviously didn't."

It's meme coin nihilism distilled into a smart contract: no pretense of value, no roadmap beyond boost schedules, just pure speculative velocity with an expiration date."

With the current market cap at $4,700 and sell volume ($108K) slightly exceeding buy volume ($104K), the net loss to late buyers is likely in the $50K-$100K range — modest by Solana rug standards but painful for the individuals involved."

          "question": "What is the 'honest rug' meta?",
          "answer": "A growing trend on Pump.fun where tokens openly announce they have no long-term value proposition, betting that traders will participate anyway for the PvP thrill. The transparency doesn't prevent losses — it just shifts blame from the creator to the buyer."
