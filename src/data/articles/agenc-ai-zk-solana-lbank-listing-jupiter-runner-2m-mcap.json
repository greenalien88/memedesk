Chinese CT scanner communities (GMGN-based) caught the early move and documented 14x+ returns from the launch price."

However, the dev wallet holds 10.3% of supply, top holders control 40.6%, and 13.2% of holders are classified as snipers. The 45% 24h price drop means the first wave already exited. DYOR and size appropriately."
