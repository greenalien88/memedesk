The project is positioning as a 'privacy-preserving AI agent coordination protocol with ZK proofs' on Solana — a project that sits at the intersection of two hot 2026 metas: AI agents and ZK privacy. That's a compelling narrative on paper. AI agent tokens were one of the dominant themes of late 2025, and ZK technology gives it a technical credibility layer that most meme coins don't bother with."

The dev wallet still holds 10.3% of supply, and there have been 2 dev migrations and 2 dev mints noted on-chain, which warrants caution."

If one of those wallets exits, the chart feels it immediately. • **Dev balance: 10.3%** — The developer still holds over a tenth of the total supply. On a $2M cap, that's ~$210K worth. Dev wallets dumping is the most common death event for Pump.fun graduates. • **Snipers: 13.2%** — Snipers bought in at launch before most retail could get a position. They're now sitting on profit at almost any price above the opening seconds. They will sell. • **Bot holders: 572 wallets (17.2%)** — Over one in six holders is classified as a bot by Jupiter's analysis. The organic buyer count in the last 24h was only 262 out of 5,261 total traders. That's 5% organic activity. The volume looks big; the human participation behind it is much smaller. • **Dev migrations: 2, Dev mints: 2** — These are on-chain footprints that show the developer moved funds and minted tokens after launch. Worth watching."

The 17.2% bot-holder count is the clearest evidence that this isn't a purely organic market. The real story is that the LBank listing and the AI narrative brought real eyes, but the Pump.fun launch mechanics also brought the usual sniper and bot activity that follows any token with early momentum."

Chinese CT scanner communities (GMGN-based) caught the early move and documented 14x+ returns from the launch price."

However, the dev wallet holds 10.3% of supply, top holders control 40.6%, and 13.2% of holders are classified as snipers. The 45% 24h price drop means the first wave already exited. DYOR and size appropriately."
