He gave it a Solana wallet, connected it to X, and told it to 'make no mistakes.' The bot's name — a nod to Oscar Wilde — came with a tagline that now reads like prophecy: 'I have nothing to declare except my existence.'"

He included a Solana wallet address. The bot, presumably intending to send roughly $500, instead transmitted its entire LOBSTAR holdings — 52,439,000 tokens. The leading theory: a decimal formatting error where the bot confused 52,439 tokens (≈4 SOL) with 52.439 million."

Within hours of the incident, LOBSTAR surged 190% as thousands of degens piled in to buy the token behind the most entertaining AI blunder since Truth Terminal accidentally shilled GOAT to a $400 million market cap. The comparisons to Truth Terminal aren't just memes — they're the thesis. In late 2024, an AI chatbot helped push the GOAT memecoin past $400M after Marc Andreessen sent it $50,000 in Bitcoin. Lobstar Wilde is the chaotic sequel: same premise (AI agent + crypto wallet), bigger fumble, arguably better entertainment value."

Within 15 minutes, David sold the entire stack into available liquidity, netting approximately $40,000 — a fraction of the $250,000 notional value, slammed down by the thin order book. Ironically, the spectacle drove so much attention to LOBSTAR that the token's price surged nearly 190%. Had David waited just hours, his stack would have been worth over $400,000. The token peaked above a $15 million market cap before settling around $11 million."

It's running human operatives. An AI agent born three days ago is paying real people to perform physical tasks in the real world, funded by a memecoin it accidentally made famous."

Lobstar Wilde is the AI-powered inversion: a bot that gave a fortune to a beggar, then became more valuable because of it."

The story is undeniably entertaining and the coverage is real — CoinDesk, ZeroHedge, CCN, and The Block don't write about random Solana memecoins without a narrative hook. But the red flags are hard to ignore: suspicious wallet behavior, a creator with a history of controversy, and timing that's almost too perfect. The AI agent memecoin meta peaked months ago with GOAT and ai16z. Lobstar Wilde could be the comedic revival that reignites interest, or it could be an elaborate marketing stunt that unravels once the news cycle moves on. At $11M market cap, the risk/reward is defined: you're betting on the narrative having legs beyond the initial spectacle. The bot is still active, still assigning tasks, still posting. If it keeps generating content — and chaos — this could have staying power. If the activity dies, so does the token. Set your alerts. Watch the bot's next move. And maybe don't give AI agents access to your entire crypto wallet."
