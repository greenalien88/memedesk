The timing matters: tokens that graduate during Asian trading hours often build an initial holder base from a different demographic than the typical CT-driven Western launches, which can create a more geographically distributed (and therefore more resilient) holder base."

      "text": "The name itself is layered. 'Aslan' is immediately recognizable to anyone who grew up with C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia — the great lion, a symbol of power, wisdom, and sacrifice. But the token's full name, 'The Tibetan Snow Lion,' adds a different cultural dimension. The snow lion is one of the Four Dignities of Tibetan Buddhism, representing fearlessness and unconditional cheerfulness. It appears on the Tibetan flag and has deep significance in Himalayan culture."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "For meme token markets, this kind of cultural depth is unusual. Most Pump.fun launches are named after the day's trending headline (see: every Iran/war/oil token launched today). $Aslan's mythological grounding gives it a narrative that doesn't expire with the news cycle — it's not tied to a specific event that loses relevance in 24 hours. Whether that translates to sustained trading interest is the million-dollar question (literally, at its current market cap)."

For comparison, some of the war meme tokens we covered earlier today had ratios of 36:1 (BELLATOR) and 38:1 (ClaudeGate). $Aslan's more moderate ratio suggests organic accumulation rather than frantic day-trading — people are buying and holding, not churning."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The 57.1% buy ratio at 66,030 transactions tells a clear story: net accumulation. Every transaction window has more buyers than sellers, which at 6 hours old indicates the token hasn't entered its distribution phase yet. Early holders aren't dumping — they're sitting, which is either conviction or illiquidity-forced holding (with $252K in liquidity, it's likely a mix of both)."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Liquidity at $252K is the strongest metric in $Aslan's profile. This is deeper than most tokens that hit Jupiter's Runners — substantially deeper than the $29K (ClaudeGate) or $24K (WarClaude) pools we've seen on today's trending tokens. $252K means the token can absorb $5-10K sells without catastrophic slippage, which makes it tradeable for more than just micro-positions."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The +7,674% gain from launch price is dramatic but expected for a Pump.fun graduation that hits Runners. The bonding curve mechanism means early buyers get in at fractional prices, and the graduation itself represents a significant price level. What matters more than the percentage is the trajectory since graduation — and the -7% hourly change at time of scan suggests the initial euphoria is cooling into a consolidation phase."

A search for KOL calls on $Aslan returns nothing from the usual suspects — no Ansem, no Murad, no mid-tier CT accounts with 10K+ followers amplifying the token. At time of writing, $Aslan appears to be running entirely on organic discovery rather than influencer-driven FOMO."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This is a double-edged signal. On the positive side, organic growth without KOL backing means the price isn't being propped up by someone with a vested interest in pumping and dumping. The 3,341 holders found this token through Jupiter's interface, DexScreener trending, or word-of-mouth — not because a 500K-follower account told them to ape. Organic discovery often produces more durable holder bases because the buyers are self-selected rather than herd-driven."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "On the negative side, the absence of KOL attention means there's no influencer infrastructure sustaining the narrative. When the initial momentum fades — and it always fades — there's no one with a large platform creating content to reignite interest. The token lives and dies by its own trading momentum and the stickiness of its cultural concept."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "If a mid-tier CT account (50K-200K followers) picks up $Aslan in the next 12-24 hours, the dynamics could shift dramatically. A single viral thread about the 'Snow Lion that conquered Jupiter's Runners' could drive a second wave of volume. But that's speculation, not data."

For a Pump.fun token, this is about as clean as it gets on the security fundamentals."

Ten migrations is notable and worth monitoring."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Top holder concentration at 17.6% is moderate. It means the top wallets control about one-sixth of the supply — enough to influence price if they coordinate, but not so concentrated that a single dump would be catastrophic. For a 6-hour-old Pump.fun graduation, 17.6% is actually lower than average."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The bot holder count at 28.5% is the most concerning metric. Nearly a third of holders are identified as bots, which inflates the 3,341 holder count. The 'real' holder base is likely closer to 2,400 — still substantial, but the gap between reported and actual holders is worth noting."

          "answer": "Jupiter's organic score measures how authentic a token's trading activity is, ranging from 0-100. An 85.6 'high' rating means Jupiter's algorithm has high confidence that the trading volume comes from real human traders rather than bots or wash trading.

While $Aslan has a cleaner security profile than most (disabled mint/freeze, low sniper rate), it's still a 6-hour-old token with 28.5% bot holders, 10 dev migrations, and zero KOL backing. The $252K liquidity provides better exit options than most micro-caps, but extreme volatility should be expected."

          "question": "Who is behind $Aslan?",
          "answer": "The token's social presence links to @Meehan1x on Twitter, who is not an established CT figure. The developer has disabled mint and freeze authority (positive signs), but the 10 dev wallet migrations warrant monitoring. No doxxed team, no website, no Telegram community has been identified."
