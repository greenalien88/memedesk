Within its first day, the token migrated to PumpSwap and began attracting volume that dwarfed its liquidity pool. By February 25, the pair had accumulated $3.8M in 24-hour volume against a pool holding just 708 SOL and 35.8 million AUTISM (~$116K total). The token sits at $0.001619 with a fully diluted valuation of $1.6M on a total supply of 999.99 million tokens."

This isn't a one-sided pump with bag holders waiting to exit — it's a high-velocity trading arena where degens are flipping the token with conviction on both sides."

From $PEPE reclaiming a cartoon frog to $DOGE turning Shiba Inus into a financial instrument, the playbook is well-documented: take something the internet already cares about, slap a ticker on it, and let degeneracy do the rest. But $AUTISM hits a specific nerve in Crypto Twitter, where 'autism' has long been used as shorthand for the obsessive, pattern-recognizing, sleep-deprived behavior that defines the most successful traders."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The tagline 'We All Have Autism' isn't just a meme — it's a CT inside joke weaponized into a token. Every trader who's spent 19 hours staring at a 1-minute chart, every anon who can recite a token's holder distribution from memory, every degen who chose on-chain analysis over human connection — they see themselves in this ticker. That's what makes identity memes dangerous: they don't need a catalyst because the community IS the catalyst."

At 60,359 unique makers in 36 hours, $AUTISM has achieved broader participation than tokens ten times its market cap typically see in a week. The 51,718 unique buyers versus 50,019 unique sellers shows remarkably balanced distribution — this isn't a single whale farming exits."

For context, anything above 10:1 on a PumpSwap micro-cap signals extreme slippage risk. A $5,000 market sell at current depth would move the price more than most traders expect. The token passed DexScreener's automated audit with no issues flagged, but 'no issues' on a 36-hour-old pump.fun token means 'no smart contract exploits detected' — not 'this is safe.'"

Nobody needs a catalyst to stay interested. $DOGE survived years of irrelevance because dog-lovers kept the meme alive. $PEPE persisted because frog posting never died."

The overwhelming majority go to zero within days. $116K in liquidity means any coordinated exit — or even a handful of early buyers taking profit — could crater the price 50% or more in minutes. The balanced buy-sell volume could flip to sell-dominant at any moment. And 'culture moment' doesn't mean 'lasting value' — it means 'people paid attention for 48 hours.'"

But $1.6M market cap with $116K liquidity is a house built on a puddle. The 60K maker count is genuinely notable — that's broad distribution, not whale games. Watch whether the community sustains after the initial volume surge fades. If daily volume holds above $1M through the weekend, this might have legs. If it drops below $500K, the exit door gets very narrow very fast."
