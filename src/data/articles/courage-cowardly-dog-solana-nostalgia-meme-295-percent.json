      "text": "Courage the Cowardly Dog — the Cartoon Network series that ran from 1999 to 2002 featuring a pink dog living in a haunted farmhouse in 'Nowhere, Kansas' — became a cult classic that never left the internet's memory. It was unsettling, funny, and emotionally resonant in a way most children's cartoons weren't. Decades later, that resonance has found a new expression: a Solana meme coin."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "$COURAGE launched on Solana's Pump.fun ecosystem and immediately attracted retail attention. The +295% move over 24 hours with 27,926 transactions — a notably high count for a fresh micro-cap — suggests the IP resonated across multiple entry waves. Unlike purely speculative launches with thin buyer bases, a 70% buy ratio across nearly 28K transactions indicates sustained demand, not a single coordinated pump."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "On Crypto Twitter, nostalgia IP plays have a consistent meta: they work because everyone already knows the character. No one needs to explain who Courage is. The dog's expression — wide-eyed terror — maps perfectly onto the emotional experience of trading meme tokens: everything feels like a monster attacking your portfolio from behind. The meme writes itself. When that cultural shortcut aligns with genuine launch momentum (not just a tweet), you get organic community formation fast. $COURAGE's 27K+ transaction count in 24 hours is evidence of exactly that."

Price change over 24 hours is +295%. Buy-to-sell ratio across transactions is 70% buys. These numbers paint a picture of a token still in active accumulation phase rather than distribution."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The $139K market cap is remarkably low given the volume generated. For context: $COURAGE is generating $822K in daily volume on a $139K mcap — that's a 5.9x daily volume-to-mcap ratio. When volume consistently exceeds market cap, it typically signals either exceptional community engagement or significant wash trading. The 70% buy ratio and 27K+ transaction count lean toward the former."

The question is whether the team behind it (if there is one) or the emergent community can extend the story beyond 'remember this show?'"

      "text": "The nostalgia meta in crypto is structural, not random. As the early adopter cohort ages — people who bought their first Bitcoin or Ethereum in 2017-2020 are now well into their 30s — the cultural references that resonate shift toward 90s and early 2000s content. Courage the Cowardly Dog sits squarely in that window. It's also dark enough to fit crypto's aesthetic naturally. Other nostalgia-themed tokens from shows like Dexter's Lab, Johnny Bravo, or Samurai Jack would face the same calculus: recognition without narrative depth unless the community builds it."

It is based on recognizable IP but has no formal relationship with the intellectual property holders. Risk only capital you can afford to lose entirely."

Combined with a genuine launch spike (70% buy pressure, 27K+ transactions), the recognition factor catalyzed organic community interest."

        {
          "question": "Does this meme coin have official Cartoon Network affiliation?",
          "answer": "No. $COURAGE is an unofficial community-created meme token. It has no affiliation with Cartoon Network, Turner Broadcasting, or Warner Bros. Discovery. Nostalgia-themed tokens operate in a legal grey area regarding IP usage."
