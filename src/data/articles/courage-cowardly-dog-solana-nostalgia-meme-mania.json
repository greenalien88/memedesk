The $COURAGE token launched via PumpSwap and immediately tapped into something that price charts alone can't explain: the millennial nostalgia trade."

The 70% buy ratio — significantly higher than the typical 55-60% for new Solana memes — suggests that buyers aren't flipping. They're holding, at least for now."

The show's bizarre aesthetic, its genuinely unsettling villains, and the universal experience of being scared as a kid watching it create an emotional anchor that pure number-go-up tokens can't replicate."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This emotional attachment translates into a measurable on-chain behavior: higher hold rates and stronger buy ratios. The 70% buy ratio on $COURAGE is among the highest of any new Solana meme this scan cycle. Traders who buy because they remember Eustace's \"Stupid dog!\" catchphrase are psychologically different from traders who buy because a chart has a green candle."

Every Courage meme shared on CT is free marketing."

Once everyone who recognizes Courage has either bought or decided not to, there's no new buyer pool. The 70% buy ratio will eventually flip, and when it does, $31K liquidity won't absorb the selling pressure gracefully."

The transaction count and buy ratio are genuinely impressive for a sub-$200K market cap token, and the emotional resonance of the Courage IP gives it more staying power than random animal tokens. But $31K liquidity on a token that's already 3x'd means the risk-reward math is getting thinner by the hour. Like the show itself, $COURAGE is charming, slightly terrifying, and probably going to end in a way nobody fully expects. The things Courage does for love — and degens do for profit."

          "answer": "$COURAGE (The Cowardly Dog) is a Solana meme token themed around the classic Cartoon Network show that aired from 1999-2002. It has no official connection to Cartoon Network, Warner Bros, or the show's creators. It's a community-created nostalgia token trading on PumpSwap."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why are nostalgia tokens popular in crypto?",
          "answer": "Nostalgia tokens tap into emotional connections that pure speculation can't replicate. When traders buy a token named after a childhood favorite, they're more likely to hold and share it on social media, creating organic marketing. The core crypto trading demographic (25-35 year olds) grew up with '90s and 2000s cartoons, creating a large built-in audience."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the 70% buy ratio a good sign?",
          "answer": "A 70% buy ratio indicates strong one-directional demand, which is bullish short-term but unsustainable long-term. Eventually buyers run out and the ratio flips. With only $31K liquidity, the transition from buy-heavy to sell-heavy could be very sharp. Think of it as a coiled spring — great for momentum, risky for anyone who doesn't exit before the flip."
