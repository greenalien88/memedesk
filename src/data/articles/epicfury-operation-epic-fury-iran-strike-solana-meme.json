Peace token pumps would absorb the liquidity. Second, the $119K liquidity means that even at $9M mcap, a coordinated sell of 2-3% of the supply could trigger a cascading dump. War tokens attract volatile traders, and volatile traders create volatile exits."

The $9M market cap, $119K liquidity, and 63% buy ratio all suggest real market interest beyond simple pump-and-dump mechanics. But this is fundamentally a bet on escalation — the token's upside is correlated with human tragedy, and its downside arrives the moment the news cycle moves on. The $119K liquidity provides a better exit than most war tokens, but it's still thin for a $9M position. Trade the headline cycle, not the thesis."

Its name is the literal operation codename, giving it first-mover advantage as the 'official' meme for the event. The 63% buy ratio suggests ongoing accumulation."

          "q": "How long will geopolitical meme tokens last?",
          "a": "Their lifespan is tied directly to the news cycle. If the Iran situation escalates (retaliation, UN sessions, further strikes), expect sustained volume. If it de-escalates quickly, the tokens will bleed. The war meta has been active for over a week on Solana, suggesting some baseline demand for geopolitical speculation."
