But below the top 100, a pocket of mid-cap memes is aggressively decoupling. NEET went from $0.013 to $0.022 in seven days while BTC dropped from $72K to $67K. SIREN surged from $0.21 to $0.30 in the same window. BAN climbed from $0.096 to $0.122 while maintaining a measured -0.34 correlation with Bitcoin — meaning it's not just surviving the crash, it's feeding on it."

When mid-cap memes pump during a macro selloff, it typically means one of three things: (1) smart money is rotating out of large caps into higher-beta plays for the bounce, (2) these tokens have independent catalysts driving demand, or (3) low liquidity is magnifying small buy orders into outsized candles. The truth is probably a mix of all three — but the convergence of multiple unrelated tokens all pumping against the trend at the same time tilts the signal toward rotation rather than coincidence."

It's up 69% in a week with 14,100 holders and a $22M market cap. The ratio of holders-to-mcap suggests genuine community distribution rather than whale concentration.

At $122M market cap with $8M daily volume, it has enough liquidity to be tradeable without catastrophic slippage."

      "text": "Here's the uncomfortable truth: meme coins often bottom before the broader market does. In the 2024 drawdown, tokens like PEPE and BONK found local bottoms 2-3 weeks before BTC stabilized. The logic: degen capital is the first to leave and the first to return. When the Fear Index hits 'Extreme Fear,' the degens who survived the crash start looking for asymmetric bets. Mid-cap memes with momentum — especially ones decoupled from BTC — become magnets for this capital. It's not rational. It's not fundamental. But it's a pattern that has repeated enough times to be actionable."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The counter-argument is equally valid: pumps during 'Extreme Fear' can be dead cat bounces or liquidity traps. When the broader market is in freefall, any token that's going up becomes a target for capital that has nowhere else to go — creating artificial demand that evaporates the moment BTC stabilizes. The difference between a rotation signal and a trap is usually visible in volume persistence. If NEET, SIREN, and BAN maintain elevated volume for 48+ hours after this article, the rotation thesis strengthens. If volume collapses, exit."

If you're looking to enter: NEET at $0.022 with a stop at $0.0158 gives you a defined risk/reward. SIREN needs to hold $0.258 to maintain its bullish structure. BAN is the cleanest thesis as a BTC-inverse play, but only works if Bitcoin stays weak. The moment BTC bounces, all three could reverse hard. Trade the setup, not the narrative. Set your alerts. Do your own research. And remember: in Extreme Fear, the people making money are either brilliant or lucky. You won't know which until after."

          "question": "Why are some meme coins pumping while Bitcoin is crashing?",
          "answer": "Several factors can drive meme coin divergence during BTC crashes: rotation of degen capital into higher-beta plays, independent catalysts (community growth, exchange listings), and low liquidity amplifying small buy orders. This pattern has historically occurred near local market bottoms, but it can also signal a liquidity trap."

          "question": "What is the Fear and Greed Index?",
          "answer": "The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures market sentiment on a scale from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). It uses volatility, volume, social media, surveys, Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. 'Extreme Fear' readings often correlate with market bottoms, but not always."

        {
          "question": "Is NEET a good investment?",
          "answer": "NEET is a highly speculative meme coin with a $22M market cap and 14,100 holders. While it has shown strong momentum (+69% in 7 days), its low market cap makes it vulnerable to manipulation. Only invest what you can afford to lose completely."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does inverse correlation with Bitcoin mean?",
          "answer": "When a token has a negative correlation with Bitcoin (like BAN's -0.34), it tends to move in the opposite direction. When BTC goes down, the token goes up, and vice versa. This can make it useful as a hedge, but the correlation can shift over time."
