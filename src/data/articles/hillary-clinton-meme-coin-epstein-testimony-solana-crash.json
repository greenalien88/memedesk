She told reporters afterward that she 'answered every one of their questions,' denied ever meeting Epstein, and claimed no relationship with associate Ghislaine Maxwell. A Republican lawmaker reportedly asked about UFOs and Pizzagate. It was, by all accounts, a spectacle."

The $Hillary token — featuring Clinton's face as its logo and literally linking to the Forbes article about her testimony as its 'website' — launched on Pump.fun hours before the deposition began. It pumped hard on the event anticipation, peaked during the testimony, and is now bleeding out at -51% as the news cycle moves on. Welcome to 2026, where congressional hearings are just another catalyst for Raydium liquidity pools."

      "text": "The Hillary Clinton Epstein testimony was one of the most anticipated political events of the week. The former presidential candidate was compelled to testify before House lawmakers investigating Epstein's network of associates. According to NBC News, the AP, The New York Times, and The Guardian — all running live updates — Clinton arrived at the Center for Performing Arts in Chappaqua, N.Y., 'defiant about being compelled to participate.' She denied knowing Epstein, denied any relationship with Maxwell, and told reporters she answered questions 'as fully as I could.'"

      "text": "The testimony was interrupted when a photo was leaked, prompting Clinton to demand the deposition be made public. The drama was catnip for both mainstream media and Crypto Twitter — and the $Hillary token existed specifically to capture that attention as tradeable volatility."

      "text": "Political event coins have become a recognizable sub-genre in the meme token ecosystem. The playbook is simple: identify an upcoming event with guaranteed media attention, launch a token themed around it, ride the news cycle pump, and exit before the story goes stale. We've seen it with $TRUMP, $MELANIA, impeachment coins, and State of the Union tokens. The $Hillary Epstein testimony coin follows the exact same template."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "What makes this iteration notable isn't the token itself — it's how efficiently the machine operates now. The token was live on Pump.fun with an X community page and a Forbes article link before the testimony even began. The creator didn't need to wait for the event to happen. The announcement was the product. By the time Clinton said 'I answered every one of their questions,' the smart money was already selling into the post-testimony dump."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This is the maturation of what Perplexity's analysis flagged as 'meme coin politics fatigue' — the same pattern that killed $MELANIA (-96% from insider dumps according to reporting by the Economic Times). Traders have seen this playbook enough times that the cycle compresses: the pump happens faster, the dump happens faster, and the window for retail profit gets narrower each time."

The volume-to-market-cap ratio of 17.9x is absurdly high — meaning the token's entire market cap has been traded through nearly 18 times. That's not investment; that's hot potato. The 61% buy ratio might look bullish at first glance, but combined with a -51% price suggests that new buyers are buying into an already-deflating balloon, with earlier holders distributing at lower and lower prices."

For context, in a healthy market, you'd expect a volume-to-liquidity ratio of 5-10x at most. At 29x, slippage on any trade above $500 would be significant, and the pool is essentially a revolving door of capital flowing in and out."

Once Clinton finished testifying, the news cycle moved on, and the token lost its only source of narrative fuel. There is no community building a 'Hillary Clinton Meme Coin' ecosystem. There is no roadmap. There is no second act."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The 1-hour change of +26% at the time of writing suggests a brief dead cat bounce — likely driven by new buyers who saw the -51% dip as a 'discount' without understanding that political event coins don't recover after their catalyst expires. The 5-minute change of +9.8% reinforces this: volatile micro-bounces within a larger downtrend, classic distribution behavior."

Political meme coins are becoming shorter, sharper, and more ruthlessly efficient at extracting value from attention. The window for retail profit is measured in minutes, not hours."

The 61% buy ratio at -51% means new money is still flowing in — directly into the pockets of earlier holders exiting. The Epstein testimony was real news; the meme coin built on it is a trap. The Clinton-Epstein saga will continue in the courts and in Congress, but this token won't be part of that story."

          "question": "Is $Hillary connected to Hillary Clinton?",
          "answer": "No. This is an unauthorized meme coin using Clinton's name and likeness. She has no involvement with or endorsement of the token."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is the price still falling?",
          "answer": "Political event coins have a natural expiration date tied to their catalyst. Once the testimony ended, the news cycle moved on and the token lost its only narrative driver. The -51% drop is consistent with the typical post-event dump pattern seen in similar political meme coins."
        },
        {
          "question": "Could it recover?",
          "answer": "Unlikely. Political event coins that don't have sustained community building, celebrity endorsement, or exchange listing pipelines typically continue declining after their catalyst passes. $MELANIA, which had far more backing, still crashed 96%."
