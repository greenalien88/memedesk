Jellybean won with 81.3% of the ballot. The zoo president smiled. America went 'aww.' And somewhere on Solana, the degeneracy machine was already spinning up."

The community-claimed token has attracted 37,442 transactions across 14 trading pairs, with a dedicated website (jellybean.meme) and an active Twitter account (@jellybeanonsol).

The Moo Deng meme economy at its peak represented hundreds of millions in market cap across multiple tokens. The thesis was simple: cute baby animal goes viral, internet makes it a meme, crypto financializes the meme, degeneracy ensues."

The key differences: the name reveal happened on national television (TODAY show, not just social media), the community takeover was organized within 24 hours of the announcement, and the token already has professional infrastructure — a .meme domain, coordinated social accounts, and the kind of branding that suggests experienced meme coin operators, not random deployers."

That kind of coordination is what separates tokens that hit $7M from tokens that die at $50K."

This is the 'franchise-ification' of meme coins in real time: a successful token spawns lore extensions, each one a new speculative vehicle riding the parent's momentum."

In the Moo Deng era, derivative tokens took days to emerge. In the Jellybean era, it took hours. The meme coin factory is getting faster, and the market's ability to narrativize, extend, and monetize a single cute animal moment is approaching real-time efficiency."

      "text": "The Jellybean phenomenon sits at the intersection of several trends that define the 2026 meme market. First, the 'IRL catalyst' thesis — tokens with real-world events behind them (zoo naming, political hearings, celebrity moments) consistently outperform purely internet-native memes. The TODAY show appearance gave Jellybean something most meme coins never have: mainstream awareness from a non-crypto audience."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Second, the 'community claim' mechanism represents an evolution in meme coin coordination. Rather than developers launching tokens and communities forming around them, communities are now forming first (around a viral moment) and then selecting which token to rally behind. This bottom-up coordination produces more organic holder distributions and stronger community attachment than top-down launches."

    {

      "text": "Third, the Moo Deng comparison sets both the bull case and the bear case. The bull case: Moo Deng tokens hit hundreds of millions in market cap, and Jellybean has better initial infrastructure and mainstream visibility. The bear case: Moo Deng also produced dozens of tokens that went to zero, and the animal-meme cycle may be showing signs of fatigue after multiple iterations."

      "type": "paragraph",

    {
      "type": "verdict",
      "rating": "speculative",
      "content": "🟡 **Speculative** — Jellybean is the strongest organic culture-moment meme coin we've tracked this cycle. The IRL catalyst (national TV name reveal), the community coordination (claimed within 24 hours), the market metrics ($5.6M volume, $285K liquidity, 37K transactions), and the derivative economy (LOLLIPOP already pumping) all point to a token with genuine narrative legs. The Moo Deng comparison is both the bull thesis and the risk factor — it proves the playbook works but also that these cycles have a shelf life. At $7M mcap, there's significant room to run if the mainstream media picks up the 'zoo hippo becomes meme coin' story, but there's also a lot of air under the price if momentum stalls. The quality of execution here is institutional-grade by meme coin standards."
