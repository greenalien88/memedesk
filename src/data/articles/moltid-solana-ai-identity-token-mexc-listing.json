Can you trust its outputs? MoltID uses Metaplex NFTs as identity containers and autonomous wallets as the action layer \u2014 essentially giving AI agents a passport that lives on Solana."

This suggests more holding behavior than flipping, which aligns with a utility narrative where buyers are betting on the product rather than just riding momentum."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The 62% buy ratio is the strongest demand signal in this scan cycle. Above 60% on a token that's already up 183% means new buyers are still entering with conviction. Liquidity at $124K is solid for a $1M cap \u2014 roughly 12% liquidity depth, which is healthy by Solana meme standards."

Exchange listings for sub-$5M tokens typically generate a 24-48 hour volume spike as CEX traders who don't use DEXs gain access for the first time.

The AI identity layer thesis is technically interesting, the MEXC listing provides a near-term catalyst, and the on-chain data shows genuine demand rather than pure speculation. But 'interesting thesis' and 'successful token' are different things. The market is littered with good ideas that never shipped, and MoltID needs to deliver actual adoption \u2014 AI agents actually using its identity framework \u2014 to justify the current cap. For now, it's the most compelling 'utility meme' in this cycle. Whether that's enough depends on whether the product catches up to the narrative."

          "question": "What does the MEXC listing mean?",
          "answer": "MEXC is a major centralized crypto exchange. A listing means MoltID becomes tradeable on MEXC's platform, exposing it to millions of CEX users who may not use Solana DEXs. Exchange listings typically generate short-term volume spikes and increase token visibility."

          "question": "Is MoltID just another AI meme coin?",
          "answer": "MoltID positions itself as utility-first rather than pure meme. The Metaplex NFT identity framework and autonomous wallet integration suggest genuine technical work. However, the gap between whitepaper promises and shipped product is where many tokens fail. The AI identity niche is real but unproven in terms of market demand."
