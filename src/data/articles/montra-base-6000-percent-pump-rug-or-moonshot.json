On paper, this is the kind of launch that makes CT lose its collective mind. But there's one number buried in the data that tells a very different story: a 31% buy ratio. When less than a third of transactions are buys on a token that's up 6,145%, someone is distributing \u2014 hard."

That pitch alone puts it in a different category from the typical animal or celebrity meme.

      "text": "The $233K liquidity pool is genuinely notable. Most Base meme launches struggle to maintain $20-50K in LP. $233K suggests either the team seeded heavily or large LPs were attracted early. That liquidity depth makes the token tradeable at sizes most Base memes can't handle \u2014 but it also means someone had the capital to set this up professionally."

    {

      "text": "But the 31% buy ratio is where this story gets uncomfortable. In a healthy rally, buy ratios typically sit at 55-65%. Even in cooling phases, they rarely drop below 45%. At 31%, sellers outnumber buyers roughly 2:1. This means for every dollar flowing in, roughly two dollars are flowing out. The price can only maintain its level because the selling is happening at higher prices than the buying \u2014 a textbook distribution pattern where early holders are taking profit into new buyer flow."

      "type": "paragraph",

But the 31% buy ratio is a number you can't talk around. Someone who got in early is leaving, and they're doing it at scale. The question isn't whether MONTRA was a good trade \u2014 it clearly was, for those who got in early. The question is whether it's still a good trade now, with distribution already underway. History suggests the answer is no. Watch the buy ratio: if it climbs back above 50%, this story changes. If it stays below 35%, you're watching a slow-motion exit."

          "question": "What is MontraFinance?",
          "answer": "MontraFinance ($MONTRA) is a Base-chain token positioning itself as an autonomous AI quant trading agent. It claims to feature a Web4 stack with ERC-8004 and XMTP integration. However, the token has no publicly verified team, and the AI narrative hasn't been independently validated."
        },
        {
          "question": "What does a 31% buy ratio mean?",
          "answer": "A 31% buy ratio means that only 31% of transactions in the past 24 hours were buys, while 69% were sells. In a healthy market, buys typically outnumber sells or run close to 50/50. A ratio this low while the price remains elevated indicates systematic distribution \u2014 early holders are selling into new buyer demand."

        {
          "question": "Is $MONTRA a rug pull?",
          "answer": "We can't confirm whether MONTRA is a rug pull. The deep liquidity ($233K) and high transaction count are positive signs. However, the extreme buy/sell imbalance, anonymous team, and pattern similarity to recent Base token rugs are significant concerns. The on-chain data suggests heavy distribution, which is a precursor to sharp price drops in many cases."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why is Base seeing so many meme token launches?",
          "answer": "Base (Coinbase's L2) has positioned itself as a culture and DeFi hub with low fees, attracting meme token creators. The chain benefits from Coinbase association and has cultivated a 'community-first' branding. However, the smaller ecosystem also means fewer organic buyers, making tokens more vulnerable to coordinated pumps and subsequent rugs."
