A way to express that the system failed them. And SPX6900 — literally named as a parody of the S&P 500 — becomes that symbol. Not because of fundamentals. Because of rage."

It's about economic displacement creating a new class of buyer who treats memecoins as protest art."

At today's $0.29, that position is worth roughly $1.9M. He hasn't sold. He's either the most patient investor in crypto or the most committed bag holder.

SPX6900, named as a parody of the S&P 500, positions itself as a \"middle finger\" to the traditional financial system — making it a natural magnet for anti-establishment sentiment."
