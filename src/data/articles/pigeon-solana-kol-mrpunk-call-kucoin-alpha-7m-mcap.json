The data showed $PIGEON sitting at 550K in search interest, wedged between the established $Maxxing at 3M and the smaller $Larp at 130K. The implicit message was clear to anyone fluent in CT subtext: 'I'm watching this one.' Within hours, $PIGEON ripped 145%, pushed through $7M market cap, and generated $3.8M in daily volume."

      "text": "Mrpunk.eth (@mrpunkdoteth) is a mid-tier KOL in the Solana meme coin ecosystem, known for data-driven calls rather than hype-driven shilling. His style is understated — posting search trend comparisons and on-chain metrics rather than rocket emojis and 'LFG' threads. His previous call on $Maxxing, which has since reached $3M market cap, gave him credibility within the degen research community. The tweet about $PIGEON wasn't an explicit 'buy' call — it was a data observation with an implied thesis, which is often more powerful because it lets the audience draw their own conclusions."

The pigeon as a meme character has deep internet roots: messenger pigeons as symbols of communication, carrier pigeons as symbols of reliability, and 'pigeon' as slang for an easy mark (which adds a layer of ironic self-awareness that CT loves)."

Launched 21 days ago on Pump.fun, it graduated to Raydium, accumulated 5,752 holders organically, earned a Moonshot verification badge, and appeared on KuCoin's Alpha listing radar — all before the KOL catalyst. Most Pump.fun tokens die within 48 hours. $PIGEON has been building for three weeks, which in meme coin time is an eternity."

The 35,214 transactions in 24 hours — roughly 1,467 trades per hour — indicates broad retail participation across thousands of wallets."

The dev balance is 0%, meaning the original deployer holds no tokens — a critical safety metric that many Pump.fun tokens fail."

KuCoin Alpha is the exchange's discovery platform for emerging tokens — a stepping stone toward full KuCoin listing. For a Pump.fun graduate, appearing on KuCoin Alpha's radar represents a significant milestone in the journey from degen launch to legitimate exchange presence. It also opens the token to KuCoin's user base of tens of millions of traders who don't interact with Solana DEXes directly."

The fundamentals are unusually solid for a meme coin: 21-day track record, 5,752 organic holders, 88.4% organic score, zero dev balance, and $589K liquidity. The dual catalyst of Mrpunk.eth's endorsement plus KuCoin Alpha listing buzz creates a narrative with multiple legs. The bear case is the sub-50% buy ratio (distribution may be happening behind the KOL hype) and the top-holder concentration at 22.6%. This is a quality speculative play with better risk metrics than 95% of what Pump.fun produces — but it's still a meme coin on Solana, and gravity always applies."

          "question": "Is the dev still holding tokens?",
