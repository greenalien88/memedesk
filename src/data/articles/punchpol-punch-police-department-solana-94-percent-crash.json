PUNCH — the Solana-based token inspired by a viral baby macaque that surged 80,000% and hit a $39M market cap — just got its first spin-off. Meet Punch Police Department ($PunchPol), a pump.fun graduate that dressed the monkey in a cop uniform, attracted $1.7M in trading volume, and is now sitting at a $33K market cap with a 94% drawdown from its intraday high.

That's the story. $PunchPol is a pump.fun token that took the PUNCH baby macaque meme — which itself went viral after a Japanese zoo rescued an abandoned monkey — and slapped a police uniform on it. The token description reads like AI-generated filler: 'Punch the monkey dressed as a police officer carefully places handcuffs on a plush companion, blending playful imagination with a touch of dramatic storytelling.' The only dramatic storytelling here is the chart."

      "text": "The original PUNCH token surged 80,000% from launch, got listed on a major CEX, and built genuine community momentum around the rescued macaque narrative. $PunchPol tried to draft behind that energy with a pump.fun launch and an X community page that leads nowhere meaningful. It graduated from the bonding curve — meaning it hit the liquidity threshold to migrate to Raydium — but graduation doesn't mean survival. It means enough early buyers pushed it through the gate before the exit door opened."

The token churned $1.7M in volume on its way up and back down, which means the vast majority of that volume was early snipers rotating in and out while retail held bags. Current on-chain activity shows 6 total transactions, 6 buyers, zero sellers, and $6.9K in remaining volume. The buy-to-sell ratio looks bullish on paper until you realize there's simply no one left to sell to."

The token's X community has no verified accounts, no engagement history, and no evidence of coordinated promotion beyond the launch itself."

      "text": "This is a pattern worth understanding even if this specific token isn't worth trading. When a meme coin goes viral — like PUNCH did with its 80,000% run — pump.fun becomes a factory for derivatives. PunchPol, PunchCat, PunchDog, PunchWhatever. Each one launches with a slight twist on the original meme, catches a few hundred thousand in volume from traders scanning for the 'next PUNCH,' and dies within hours. The original PUNCH succeeded because it had a genuine viral catalyst (a rescued baby monkey that captured mainstream attention). Derivatives have none of that. They're photocopies of photocopies."

The $1.7M in volume was entrance and exit liquidity for snipers — not a sign of genuine interest. If you're looking for PUNCH exposure, the original token is still trading with actual market cap and community behind it. This one belongs in the forensics drawer."

          "question": "Is $PunchPol related to the original PUNCH token?",
          "answer": "No. PunchPol is an unofficial derivative — a separate token launched by unknown creators on pump.fun that uses the PUNCH monkey imagery. It has no connection to the original PUNCH team or community."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I buy $PunchPol at these prices?",
          "answer": "The token has a $33K market cap, 6 buyers, and virtually zero liquidity. Even if you wanted to speculate on a bounce, there may not be enough liquidity to enter or exit a position. The chart and on-chain data suggest this token's lifecycle is complete."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why did $PunchPol pump to $1.7M in volume?",
          "answer": "Pump.fun tokens with recognizable names (especially derivatives of trending tokens) attract automated snipers and copy-traders who scan new launches. The volume represents rapid rotation by these actors, not organic community buying."
