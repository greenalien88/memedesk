For context, that's roughly 31 transactions per minute, sustained around the clock. Most new Pump.fun graduates die within the first hour with a few hundred trades. Slurmit is still churning volume at a rate that suggests genuine crowd interest, not just a single whale cycling positions."

That volume-to-mcap ratio is exceptional — anything above 2x typically signals either extreme speculation or genuine price discovery. At 1,854% gains from launch, early buyers who held are sitting on life-changing returns if they can actually exit."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Liquidity sits at $77K — not paper-thin, but not deep either. The 56% buy ratio is the most interesting data point: it's close enough to balanced that this looks like active trading rather than a one-way pump. When buy ratio sits at 70%+, you're usually looking at FOMO chasers about to become exit liquidity. At 56%, there's legitimate two-way price discovery happening."

Dog tokens split between breeds. Cat tokens are niche. Political tokens are divisive. But everyone knows what a frog looks like, and a green chart next to a green frog is the most instinctive buy signal in all of crypto."

The transaction count is legitimately impressive, the buy ratio suggests healthy price discovery, and the Futurama angle gives it slightly more cultural depth than generic frog #47. But $77K liquidity on a $701K mcap means the math gets ugly fast if sentiment flips. This is a textbook 'watch the chart, not the narrative' play — impressive launch metrics don't guarantee week-two survival in the frog meta."

          "question": "What is Slurmit The Frog?",
          "answer": "Slurmit The Frog is a Solana-native meme token that launched via PumpSwap. The name references both frog meme culture and Futurama's fictional addictive drink 'Slurm.' It has no formal utility, team, or roadmap — it's a pure meme play riding the persistent frog meta on Solana."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why does the frog meta keep working?",
          "answer": "Frog tokens benefit from universal visual recognition, infinite remixability, and zero cultural baggage. Unlike political or breed-specific tokens, frogs are a neutral canvas that works across all crypto demographics. The green color also creates a subconscious association with green (profitable) charts."

        {
          "question": "Is Slurmit safe to trade?",
          "answer": "Like all new Pump.fun-originated tokens, Slurmit carries significant risk. Liquidity is $77K against $701K market cap, there's no locked LP or renounced contract verification, and 1,854% gains mean early holders could dump at any time. The 56% buy ratio is healthier than typical pumps, but this is still a high-risk, short-timeframe trade."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Slurmit compare to other frog tokens?",
          "answer": "By transaction count (44,588 in 24h), Slurmit is among the most actively traded new frog tokens this week. For comparison, many Pump.fun graduates see only a few hundred to a few thousand trades before dying. The $3.3M volume also puts it ahead of most new launches, though it remains far below established frog tokens like PEPE in market cap and liquidity."
