      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The bear case is equally straightforward. At $44M market cap, USELESS is priced for something — even if that something is 'nothing.' Market caps this large require continuous new buyer inflow to sustain, and meme token attention is the most finite resource in crypto. The 13% gain in the last 24 hours and steady buy pressure look healthy now, but a single whale distributing their position into thin order books could trigger a cascade. And with no utility to fall back on — by design — there's no fundamental floor."

If USELESS at $44M performs comparably to (or better than) tokens with elaborate roadmaps and 'real' use cases, then the market is pricing something other than utility. It's pricing attention, community, liquidity, and narrative — the same things it's always priced, just without the pretense."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "In a perverse way, USELESS might be the most efficient meme token ever created.

At 294 days old with a $44M market cap, OKX listing, and $1.4M liquidity, it's moved beyond meme novelty into what might charitably be called 'meme infrastructure.' The anti-utility thesis is compelling as commentary and has proven durable as a trading vehicle. But $44M for a token that proudly does nothing is still $44M of speculative capital with no fundamental backstop. The irony works until it doesn't — and when it stops working, there's nothing underneath."

It has no utility, no roadmap, no staking, and no governance — by design. The token's entire premise is that it's 'useless,' which has become its defining narrative and brand identity."

          "question": "Why does USELESS COIN have a $44M market cap?",
          "answer": "Despite (or because of) its lack of utility, USELESS has built a sustained community and trading base over 10 months. Its anti-utility narrative resonates in a market fatigued by fake roadmaps and rug pulls. The OKX listing has also expanded its buyer base beyond on-chain natives."

        {
          "question": "Is USELESS COIN safe to buy?",
          "answer": "No meme token is 'safe' to buy. While USELESS has better liquidity ($1.4M) and longevity (294 days) than most meme tokens, it has no fundamental value by its own admission. Price is entirely driven by speculative demand, which can evaporate at any time."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where can you trade USELESS COIN?",
          "answer": "USELESS COIN is available on OKX (centralized exchange) and through Solana DEXes including Jupiter and Raydium. The primary trading pair is on DexScreener via the letsbonk.fun launchpad."
